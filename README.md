meta-templates
==============

a collection of HTML meta data templates to help create proper markup for products, articles and other items.

#### Reason

Meta data is both great and terrible at the same time. It can be very difficult to figure out what tags are actually needed, or even what syntax is used to create them.

#### Protocols

* [Default Meta Tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element)
* [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/)
* [schema.org](http://schema.org)
* [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card)

#### Goals

Make it easy to tag your content properly and not just dump every tag you can find.

#### Contributing

Fork this repo and either edit an existing item, or create a new template. If the template is an extension on an existing template, name you file with that template as the parent.
